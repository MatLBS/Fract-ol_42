# 42-Fract-ol

## Introduction
Fract-ol is a graphical project from 42 School that involves generating beautiful fractals from the complex numbers of an iterative mathematical construct. 
A fractal is a fragmented geometrical figure that infinitely repeats itself at smaller scales. This project uses the school's graphical library, MiniLibX.

## Usage
This project is compatible on Linux.

1.Clone the repository
```python
git clone https://github.com/MatLBS/Fract-ol_42.git
cd Fract-ol_42
```
2.Compile and lauch the project.
```python
make

./fractol mandelbrot
or
./fractol julia
or
./fractol burning_ship
```
If you enter ./fractol julia you can add one or two arguments to change the fractal.

For example if you enter ```./fractol julia 0.285 0.01```

## Controls
1. Press ```‚¨ÖÔ∏è```, ```‚û°Ô∏è```, ```‚¨ÜÔ∏è```, ```‚¨áÔ∏è``` to move the fractal.

2. Press ```x``` or ```c``` to change the color of the fractal.

3. Use the ```mouse wheel``` to zoom/dezoom.

4. You can press the buttons ```+``` / ```-``` to increase / decrease the precision of the fractal.

5. Press ```r``` to reset the fractal.

6. Press ```y``` while on Julia set so you can change the fractal with your mouse.
